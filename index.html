<b>Teaching</b><br>
Dr. Caporaso teaches graduate and undergraduate bioinformatics in the Biology and Computer Science departments at Northern Arizona University. You can find course websites and teaching materials on <a href="teaching">Dr. Caporaso's teaching website</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://caporasolab.us/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/">An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics</a> (or <i>IAB</i>) is an open source and free [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)-based introductory bioinformatics textbook being developed in the Caporaso Lab. For more information on IAB, see Dr. Caporaso's recent <a href="http://microbe.net/2014/05/01/teaching-bioinformatics-using-ipython-notebooks/">microbe.net blog post on IAB</a> and the <a href="http://caporasolab.us/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics">IAB website</a>.
<p>
<b>Software</b><br>
All of the software developed in the Caporaso Lab is open source and free, and most of it is hosted under the <a href="http://github.com/biocore">biocore GitHub organization</a>. You can find the latest information on the individual projects by looking them up there, or see a list of the lab's major software projects on the <a href="../software.html">Software</a> page. Head to <a href="http://help.qiime.org" target="_blank">help.qiime.org</a> if you're looking for help with using QIIME.
<p>
<b>Jobs</b><br>
We are always on the lookout for exceptional post-doctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduate students, research technicians, and software engineers (Python programmers, typically) to join the lab. If you're interested in the human microbiome, microbiology of the built environment (e.g., offices, homes, hospitals, etc), or developing open source bioinformatics software and would like to work in the Caporaso Lab, you should <a href="mailto:gregcaporaso@gmail.com">e-mail Greg</a>. Be sure to describe your research interests in your e-mail, and attach a CV or resume as a PDF.
