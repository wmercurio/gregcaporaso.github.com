<h3>Team 1 Project<a class="headerlink" href="#team-1-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You will investigate the effect of sequence read length on microbial community alpha diversity results, beta diversity results, and OTU category significance results. Specifically we want to know how starting with different read lengths might effect the biological conclusions that a researcher might draw from their data. Given the three data sets from Group Project 1, you will compare all of the above results with reads sliced to 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% of full read length. This will require trimming of the initial reads.</p>

<p>You will compare the QIIME 1.4.0 and mothur 1.23.1 software packages, and report on the usability, run time, and consistency of results between the two. You should have both installed on the same AWS EC2 image (you&#8217;ll need to create one - I recommend starting from the QIIME 1.4.0 image, installing mothur, and saving as a new image). Here we are interested in consistency of alpha and beta diversity results across the two systems, run times for all steps in the pipeline from OTU picking through diversity analyses, and a discussion of the pros and cons in terms of usability for each (I want an honest assessment here - don&#8217;t be biased by the fact that I&#8217;m a developer on QIIME!).
