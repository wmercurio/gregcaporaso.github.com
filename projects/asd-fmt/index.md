title: Fecal Microbiota Transplants in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
picture: "asd-fmt/profile.jpg"
abstract: "Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota have a role in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), potentially arising from their role in modulating the immune system and gastrointestinal (GI) function. GI problems such as chronic constipation and/or diarrhea are common in children with ASD, and the severity of gut problems has been shown to strongly correlate with the severity of autism. It has been established that that the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in children with ASD differs from the gut microbiota in neurotypical children, but we currently have little understanding of how changes in the gut microbiota affect ASD-related symptoms. In this study we are examining the effect of treatment with fecal microbiota transplants (FMT), on the composition and dynamics of the gut microbiota of children affected by ASD. FMT is the process of transferring gut bacteria from a healthy person to a person with gastrointestinal problems.  Specifically, we are examining the relationship between changes in behavior, GI symptoms and the gut microbial community before and after administration of the FMT treatment over the course of 18 weeks."
