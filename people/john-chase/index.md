abstract: "I recently received a master’s degree in Biology from Northern Arizona University. My undergraduate degrees from NAU are in Biology and Sociology with minors in Chemistry and Spanish. My interests are primarily genetics and bioinformatics. My master’s thesis consisted of taking samples from offices in Flagstaff, San Diego and Toronto. The 16S rRNA gene of the samples were sequenced and the bacterial communities were profiled. Extensive time series data was collected as well. I am currently analyzing the data and attempting to apply new statistical techniques not commonly used in microbial ecology such as generalized linear models. I am also involved in developing [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/) and [QIIME](http://qiime.org/)".
