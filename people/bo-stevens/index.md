abstract: "I am a Masters student in Biology at NAU. I am interested in bioinformatics, ecology, remote sensing, microbiology, and the public perception of complex and novel scientific issues. For my thesis, I am working with the Nancy Johnson Lab to elicit patterns of bacterial and fungal communities within the Serengeti grasslands. In addition, I am conducting an analysis of the presence of bias among published literature on the topic of genetic modification."
