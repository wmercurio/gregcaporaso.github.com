# Background
My background is primarily in Physics. I have an M.S. in Physics from Univeristy of California, Riverside
and a B.S. in Physics from Northern Arizona University. In addtion, I have a B.S in Astronomy and a B.A. in 
Philosophy from NAU.

# Interests

I am currently working on benchmarking studies looking at four different muliple sequence aligners (MUSCLE, MAFFT, PyNAST, and SSU-ALIGN).
Each of these is being coupled with either lanemask or strictly entropy based positional alignment filtering using SciKit-Bio. 
We are looking to find out if the phylogenetic trees and diversity results are as good or better than the use of PyNAST multiple
sequence alignment with lanemask positional alignment filtering. We are creating trees using FastTree, creating distance matrices 
using SciKit-Bio, and then performing Mantel tests on those trees using SciKit-Bio to get a correlation coefficient.
