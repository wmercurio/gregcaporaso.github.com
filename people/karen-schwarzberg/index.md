abstract: "My PhD dissertation research in the UC San Diego/San Diego State University joint doctoral program combined bioinformatics methods and molecular biology to study oral polymicrobial communities and impact on human health. As a postdoctoral scholar in the Caporaso Lab, I am working on the impact of probiotics on the human gut microbiome in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In addition, I am working on developing new comparative methods that integrate different “omics” data types."
