    I am an undergraduate student at NAU with a major in Computer Science and a
    minor in Biology. I work as a software engineer, helping to develop and
    maintain many of the Bioinformatics tools we use here.

### Current Projects:

 * [scikit-bio](http://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio) - This is a core
    bioinformatics library written in Python 2/3 which is used in QIIME and
    hopefully other projects soon.
 * QIIME 2 Runtime Framework (unnamed as of yet) - This will become the
    framework on which QIIME 2 will run. Its responsibilities will include
    allowing composition of novel workflows from modular blocks of code,
    managing the execution of workflows, and maintaining the history of each
    new artifact.

### Career Goals:
My dream job is to work in synthetic biology, programming novel life. 
Unfortunately, that is not yet an employable field, living firmly in the world
of science fiction (for now...).

From a more realistic perspective, I would like to continue working in the
field of bioinformatics, with a focus on building tools to help other
researchers produce good science faster. To that end, I think a robust
world-wide system of sharing data, the semantic type and history of that data,
and computational resources needs to exist.

Academically, I would like to finish my Bachelor's Degree and then move onward
to a Master's/Ph.D. program in Bioinformatics.

### Interests:
Learning new programming paradigms is something I spend an inordinate amount
of personal time on.

I also like playing the piano, preferring to compose pieces on the fly to
reading them from a sheet.
