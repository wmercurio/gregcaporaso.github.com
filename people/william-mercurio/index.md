# Background
I am currently working towards a B.S. in Biology and Chemistry with minors in Astronomy, Mathematics, and Japanese.

# Interests

I am currently working on benchmarking studies looking at four different multiple sequence aligners (MUSCLE, MAFFT, PyNAST, and SSU-ALIGN). Each of these is being coupled with either "Lane mask" or strictly entropy based positional alignment filtering using scikit-bio.
We are looking to find out how the phylogenetic trees and diversity results compare to the use of PyNAST multiple
sequence alignment with "Lane mask" positional alignment filtering. We are creating trees using FastTree  and then measuring the Robinson-Foulds distance of those trees using scikit-bio are. We also seek to see how the different alignment and filtering methods effects the alpha and beta diversity.
