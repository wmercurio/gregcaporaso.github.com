# Background
I am currently working towards a B.S. in Biology and Chemistry with minors in Astronomy, Mathematics, and Japanese.

# Interests

I am currently working on benchmarking studies looking at four different multiple sequence aligners (MUSCLE, MAFFT, PyNAST, and SSU-ALIGN). Each of these is being coupled with either "Lane mask" or strictly entropy based positional alignment filtering using SciKit-Bio.
We are looking to find out how the phylogenetic trees and diversity results com[are to the use of PyNAST multiple
sequence alignment with "Lane mask" positional alignment filtering. We are creating trees using FastTree, creating distance matrices
using SciKit-Bio, and then performing Robinson Foulds tests on those trees using SciKit-Bio to get a correlation coefficient. We also seek to see how the different alignment and filtering methods effects the alpha and beta diversity.
